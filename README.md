# INT322 / INT332 – DevOps Virtualization & Configuration Management

This repository contains **unit-wise study material, practical notes, Docker commands, labs, and PPTs**
for the course **DevOps Virtualization & Configuration Management**.

The repository is structured using **Git branches**, where each branch represents a **separate unit**
as taught in class. This approach follows real-world DevOps practices and makes learning,
revision, and evaluation easy.

## 🌿 Branch Structure (Unit-wise)

Each unit is maintained in a **separate branch**:

| Branch Name | Unit Description |

| `main` | Course overview and repository index |
| `unit-1` | DevOps basics & Docker fundamentals |
| `unit-2` | Dockerfile, image building & container management |
| `unit-3` | Microservices using Docker Compose |

📌 **Note:** Switch branches to access unit-specific material.
